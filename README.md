# setup

## My Mac setup

### Desktop : 
A clean desktop is the best. A self-cleaning desktop is even better.

- System preferences
   - Desktop and dock
   - Desktop and stage manager
       - Show items
           - On desktop -> uncheck
           - In stage manager -> uncheck
       - Click on wallpaper to revel desktop -> Only in stage manager.
       - Stage manager -> uncheck. I hate stage manager..there...I said it.
       - Widgets
            - On desktop -> uncheck
            - In stage manager -> uncheck
